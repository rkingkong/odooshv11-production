# CitadelPackaging (CitadelPackaging-Odoo)

 - Enterprise Code :   
 
## Branches :
- SH Production Branch  : **_production_**
- Sh Staging  (You can only have three staging branches):
   - 1st staging Brnach :  **_production-copy_**
   - 2nd staging Brnach :  **TBD**
   - 3rd staging Brnach :  **TBD**
- Development (You can have as many development branches as you like): 
   - 1st Development Branch : **11.0-runbot**
   
## Code of Conduct
- **IMPOTANT : DO NOT COMMIT anything in the _production_ branch, because _production_ is _Production Instance_**
- If you want to start development branch fork new branch form _production_ or _staging_ branches and and SH will automatically start new development build.
