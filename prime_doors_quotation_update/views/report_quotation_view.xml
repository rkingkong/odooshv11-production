(“Prime Doors”). Customer’s submission of a purchase order to Prime Doors, or Customer’s acceptance of any goods from Prime Doors, shall constitute Customer’s acceptance of Prime Doors’ Terms and Conditions. Furthermore, the acceptance by Customer of any quotes or proposals received from Prime Doors is expressly limited to the terms of such quotes or proposals, and any terms or conditions proposed in Customer’s purchase orders or any other documents that are inconsistent with or in addition to Prime Doors’ Terms and Conditions are objected to and rejected by Prime Doors’. Any and all of Prime Doors Terms and Conditions are subject to change by Prime Doors without further notice to Customer. Any purchase order submitted by Customer to Prime Doors shall be subject to any and all Terms and Conditions in effect on the date on which such purchase order is submitted to Prime Doors. No purchase order shall be binding upon, or deemed accepted by, Prime Doors unless and until Prime Doors has delivered written confirmation of such acceptance to Customer. Prime Doors’ Terms and Conditions are available upon request.</p>

                                <strong>UNANTICIPATED CIRCUMSTANCES:</strong> Delivery dates are estimated and may be subject to change or delay.

In addition, if Prime Doors’ material or freight costs increase as a result of any unanticipated circumstances, the amount to be paid by Customer under any existing quotes or purchase orders shall be adjusted upward by the amount of such increased costs, and Customer shall pay such increased amount in accordance with Prime Doors’ Terms and Conditions</p>

If Customer shall fail to timely give such notice, the goods shall be deemed to conform with the terms of Customer’s purchase order and Customer shall be bound to accept and pay for the goods in accordance with Prime Doors’ Terms and Conditions. Customer expressly waives any right the Customer may have to revoke acceptance after such three (3) day period.
